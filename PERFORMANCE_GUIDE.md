# RocketHacks Website Performance Optimization Guide

## 🚀 Quick Fixes Applied:
- ✅ Reduced hero background image quality (95% → 75%)
- ✅ Added blur placeholder for faster perceived loading
- ✅ Removed unused "networking" category from gallery

## 🏗️ Production vs Development:
```bash
# Test production build performance:
npm run build
npm start

# Compare with development:
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 Performance Improvements to Consider:

### 1. Image Optimization
- Convert large PNG images to WebP format
- Compress images using tools like TinyPNG
- Use responsive images with multiple sizes

### 2. Code Splitting
- Lazy load gallery images
- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Separate vendor bundles

### 3. Animation Optimization
- Use `transform` and `opacity` for animations (GPU accelerated)
- Avoid animating `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`
- Consider `will-change` CSS property for complex animations

### 4. Bundle Analysis
```bash
# Analyze bundle size:
npm run build
npx @next/bundle-analyzer
```

### 5. Caching Strategy
- Optimize Next.js caching headers
- Use service worker for offline caching
- CDN for static assets

## 🔍 Performance Monitoring:
- Use Chrome DevTools → Performance tab
- Lighthouse audit for comprehensive analysis
- Core Web Vitals monitoring

## ⚡ Expected Improvements:
- **Development Mode**: Heavy, unoptimized, hot reloading
- **Production Mode**: 70-90% faster loading, optimized bundles
- **Image Optimization**: 20-40% faster image loading

## 📊 Quick Test:
1. Build production: `npm run build && npm start`
2. Open Chrome DevTools → Network tab
3. Compare load times and bundle sizes
